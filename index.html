When Veronica and I began dating, I had a cat, Princess.  
She was pretty, but a bit of a monster.  She was defensive and hyper alert 
around new people.  She seemed to enjoy antagonizing Veronica.  At the time, 
I wasn't immediately sympathetic towards Veronica.  The cat was declawed, 
and when she swatted at me I just ignored her, or perhaps pushed her away 
to chill her out.  Veronica made me realize I should be more sympathetic, 
and I began being more proactive about pushing Princess away from her, 
and emphasizing that Veronica was important.
  </p>
    
  <p>
Veronica decided to surprise me, and adopted a second cat, named Kasey, 
from the Humane Society.  She wanted a cat that would be more friendly 
towards her in my household, and someone to keep Princess company 
when I was at work.  She was a cute little ball of brown calico fur, 
full of enthusiasm and cuddles.  I used to carry her in my jacket 
as I went to visit people.  She especially enjoyed styling Veronica's 
hair.  She would sit behind Veronica on the couch, and tease out single 
strands of hair at a time, arranging them in designs that only a 
cat could fully appreciate.
  </p>
    
 <p>
Since Princess had been declawed long ago, it would have been dangerous to 
leave Kasey's claws intact, so she also had to have hers removed, unfortunately.  
When the two of them met, you could almost see the gears turning: Who's this?  
Could be a threat!  I can't actually fight effectively, but *she* doesn't know that... 
I know, I'll bluff, and keep out of range of *her* claws!  
They circled for days before realizing they'd been duped.  Eventually, they settled 
into an uneasy peace.
  </p>
   
<p>
After a while, Princess' behavior grew more erratic, and she was biting so hard
that she was drawing blood.  We eventually had to say goodbye to her, 
and Kasey was left as the sole cat of the home.  
  </p>
  
<p>
After Veronica and I were married, and Joey was on his way, we had to temporarily 
part with Kasey, who went to live with Veronica's parents, as we didn't know how 
she and the infant would get along.  After Joey was born, we slowly introduced them.  
She seemed to harbor no ill will towards the tiny one; as a matter of fact, she 
seemed almost protective towards him.  He would cry, and she would perch outside his 
door staring at us new parents reproachfully.  When the boy was older, he would grab 
her tail, and instead of retaliating, she would put on a patient face of long suffering, 
extract her tail and walk away, dignity intact.
</p>

  <p>
All seemed harmonious in our household, but everything changed when the little 
ball of terror known as Max joined the household.  Even as a puppy, he was twice her size, 
  and if she was ever <i>that</i> energetic, she had no recollection... 
  Would that thing ever just chill??  Maybe we'll just bat our tail in irritation, 
  let him know who's in charge here... Why is he charging?!  
  And so it continued... Eventually, even through their interspecies 
  communication troubles, they learned at least to not <i>always</i> 
  antagonize on another.  They even teamed up around mealtimes, each taking 
  part in a ritual designed to ensure the prompt delivery of foodstuffs 
  at the appropriate time.
  </p>
    
  <p>
She was canny.  One night, while Veronica was working a night shift, she was 
    stuck in my bedroom after I had curled up for the night.  She meowed at me, 
    but I told her, firmly, that I was going to bed, and she'd have to wait 
    until morning.  She meowed at me again, more insistently, and jumped up 
    on my chair, which was next to my bed near the computer desk.  
    I glanced over at her, and she looked at me, pointedly, then looked 
    down at some electric cords down by the floor, then back at me. 
    It was if she was saying "nice wires... Be a <b>shame</b> if something happened to them..."  
    I let her out, although I felt humbled, having been extorted by a cat!
  </p>

  <p>
When Joey was in second grade, for his science experiment, he decided to study 
  Kasey's relationship with the dog.  Through careful study, he learned that the 
    cat was not so much afraid of the dog as she was just <i>annoyed</i> by the dog.
  </p>
    
  <p>
This year, shortly after a close shave with cancer from the dog, 
    we noticed a discoloration on Kasey's mouth, and that her appetite was off.  
    It seems that we felt relief too soon, as later tests soon confirmed 
    that Kasey, also, had cancer.
  </p>
    
  <p>
It was aggressive, and startlingly fast, and there was no hope.  
    It was with a heavy heart that our family said goodbye to her today, 
    ironically at the very same clinic we'd said 'hello' to her 14 years before.
  </p>
  
  With sadness, 
  Justin, Veronica, and Joey Hiltscher and their big dog Max
